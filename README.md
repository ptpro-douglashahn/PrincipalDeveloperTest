This was a sample programming project that someone asked me to do.

It demonstrates my coding abilities in C#.

The sample project had the following requirements:

Write a pair of functions in compileable C# that can scramble and descramble a string of 2 to many characters. The functions have the following requirements:
  a.	The scramble function:
      i.	 accepts an input string and outputs a string key and a scrambled string
      ii.	The scramble function cannot ever return the original string
      iii.	The key must be shorter than the input string
b.	The descramble function:
    i.	Accepts a scrambled string and a key and returns the original input string
